 <h1 align="center">Basic tips</h1>
<div class="mez"> </div>
  <p>This is short quide how to do important things in Terra Militaris. Its tips what I (Corrupt) and Pejpr using to play. We are not best on server, but we are propably
  two top players in Rome and Rome need more then two. This tips are not for to be UBER PRO player, but after this you will not looks like retarded moron noob, as I see most of you. When 
  you become PRO player and your
  propably not PRO now, maybe you think you are but its a lie. Then find your way. Again this is only basic tips, basic mean play as usefull player not "How to rule server".<br> Sory for my
  bad english, but I hope you will undestand.</p>
 <div class="mez"> </div> 
 First you must understand this game is about shrine wars, everything arround is soup. When you dont fight at shrines = no reason for play = wasting of time. When you play bad, its worst
 then you dont play. For wars you need guild. You have some guild and it mean you have leader, leader talk with other leaders, he make tactics, politics and other things. When you are member you follow, dont try 
 to do other things or you can waste many things. I can type here six milion words but I dont have time for this, who have question, ask me. Contacts to me is here on my web or ingame. When you are 
 ownage PRO player dont read it. This is for noobs, I think almoust everyone are noobs :}. Im not too experienced player, but important is Battle Rank. Battle rank, you obtain it when you killing
 enemy untis and heros (PVP only). When you think some one is good fighter and he know something about terra ask him about his Rank. I have now 114 000 (at 40k you obtain first two Talents they are RLY important), players under
 80k Rank are newbies. This rank you see up near fame or in talent menu. Rank is NOT fame. 
  <div class="mez"> </div> 
  
  <h3>Heros</h3>   
  <p>
  This game is about heros, its hero wars. You need strong units, you need tons of units, you need tactics but hero is main thing. Without good hero, no sence to do anything. Clasic heros are
  Power, Int, Command. You need purple hero, blue is shit for nothing. When you cant get purple hero, you must use blue hero, but DONT use first blue hero what you obtain when you first log in (less points then
  other blue heros). Good player have many heros and minimaly 3x purple. One int, one power and one command. 
  All gear (armors, jewelery, etc) you need minimaly +6, there is a big difference between +5 and +6.<br>
  <div class="mez"> </div>
   <b>Power hero:</b> Close combat hero, strong, melee, low units. For wars you need lvl 70+. Gear 60 better 70+. Get 70 lvl gear is not hard, for this you need lvl 70+ basic power 408 (you need
    415 for skills) then other points spend on agi. Idealy you need 408+ agi at 70lvl. Dont spend any points to Inteligence or Command, when you alredy do it, reset stats. For power hero you need this skills,
    yes you need specialy this skills<br> 
    <img src="powskill.jpg">  <br>
    <b>Skills</b> Blitz, Shock Assault, Poison, Gallantry, Suppression, Warcry. <br>
    DONT try use any other skills, totaly useless and you will looks like moron!<br> 
    When you start fight, its good to use Gallantry, first what you do you use suppression, when its int hero or enemy hero running away, you
    use Warcry this give him slow on range (when you use it in Trial of champion in 10lvls to Boss you change his target to your hero!), then you are closer you use Poison another slow and dmg (more power more dmg). Then must use suppression, then Blitz and start hitting, durring hitting use Shock Assault.
    Everytime try start with Suppresion, Blitz and use during fight Shock Assault and Poison. Depend on situation, this is only example. All skills you need minimaly lvl 2, on clear power skills you need lvl 3.
  <div class="mez"> </div>
  <b>Gear</b> is most important, for power hero you need power sword 60+ and you must reinforce it to +10. When you choose power sword you need some agi equip, yes you must have, power heros without agi gear are rly 
  weak (dont look to Kleody, he have some 90gear and +10). Best way is have minimaly 3 better 4 agi gear. It give you many defence and HP +you have extra bonus. When you have 5 power gear on left side helm, armor...
  you have two bonus for units, when you wear 3x agi jewelery (jewelery is best, because power jewelery dont give you any def only HP and little power) you have another bonus for units to dmg. I prefer 3x agi gear, 2-3x jewelery 
  and mantle.<br>
  Or when you have agi sword 70+ on +10 you can use only power gear. Everytime count your bonuses, everytime watch how many HP and def you have. When you have all power things, its not good, your weak and you will die
  sooner then you can use this big dmg, trust me. But more then 4x agi gear is too much. Good hero can looks like something like that (its my)<br>

  </p>
  <div class="mez"> </div> <div class="mez"> </div>
  <b>Inteligence hero:</b> Int hero is ranged hero, you going close only when you want use suppresion, other thing to range. When you use sword to hit = bad int and you will die. Basic stuffs are almoust same as power hero
  just with int gear and int skills. DONT try put on Int hero any agi gear, its not close combat tank. He give a lot of dmg on range and to AOE. You need get max inteligence as you can. For int hero is good, when you have 70lvl, 60lvl gear,
  all +6, 60 weapon +10 and good skills, its usefull. Its hard to play Int hero, but when you are good, you can kill many many units or heros. Perfect for defence combinated with power hero. Dont spend point to power or command.<br>
  This is perfect skill setup for int hero, dont try another.<br>
  <img src="intskill.jpg">  <br>
  <b>Skills</b>: Pyromaniac, Fan of Knives, Gallantry, Flood, Suppression, Mud Trap. <br>
  With int you need take range, Fan of Knives is skill what you using to enemy heros and you will hurt them a lot, mass dmg, but single target, you can use it for units too, but its not effective. In fights you then using Pyro and Flood, most powerfull
  skills, they are ranged, AOE (multitarget), perfect on units, good to heros anyway you dont have more chances how to dmg. Gallantry you can use when you know you obtain dmg, some time it can save your life. Suppression is 
  last chance how to stop power hero and run or help friendly heros to kill some one. Mud Trap is same as Warcry (when you use it in Trial of champion in 10lvls to Boss you change his target to your hero!) AOE slow, perfect
  skill. You will rly need it in shrine battles, hmm same as others :). <br>
  <b>Gear</b> is simple int, int int try have full set minimaly all +6. <br>
  <img src="intgear.jpg">  <br>
  <div class="mez"> </div>
  
  <b>Command hero:</b> Easier hero, you need good skills, but gear is not too important. Because Command hero is something like buffer, support. His power is units, he need good gear but not too good. Points spend to
  command and some to agi. Not so important. Important is only skills, in shrines command hero normaly stay behind, using buffing mass skills or helping others fighting heros to suppression. But is totaly useless try
  kill enemy power or int hero, or try kill units with command hero. Ok skills are important.<br>
   
   <b>Skills:</b>Massive Attack, Fanatism, Suppression, Warcry, Shield Wall, Sword Braking.<br>
   During fights you stay behind and still use Massive Attack, Fanatism and Shield Wall. When you need help others or when some one hunting you, you can using Warcry to slow down targets (slow is almoust same important
   as suppression, rly usefull) or Suppression to hold them. When you rly need to fight or whe you need end some almoust dead enemy you can try Sword Braking, Suppression and try take him down with sword. But primary, hes not
   fighter.  <br>

     <div class="mez"> </div>
     
   With this heros you can fight. You can have better, but this is just tips. Always drink potions when you can. Be carefull some yellow speed skills are <b>bugged</b> NEVER use them, they dont work or they stuck your units, you see them move and they stay and etc. <br>
    <img src="gallop.jpg"><img src="bugle.jpg">
   <div class="mez"> </div>  
 <h3>Shrines !</h3> 
 First never use nation chat for any important information and important is almoust everything. Always read what your leader type. ALWAYS read chat inside shrine. NEVER go afk during shrine wars, specialy when you are
 in some fron line. When you need go afk say it. DONT try fight at shrines with low numbers or under t4 = level4 units, DONT try fight with heros under lvl 60. <br> 
    <div class="mez"> </div>
 <b>For attack:</b>Ok first you need good hero. Then you need units, for attack is good have many many pikemans t4! (t4=lvl4 gold), some
 catapults they are good t1 enough, but when you have them, you must shoot to towers or to main building NOT to units. Ofcourse good is take some gladiators and cataracts (t5). But they are expensive, long time to build.<br>
  <div class="mez"> </div>
  <b>For defence</b> you need RLY strong heros. And good setup something like 1x power 1x int 1x command or 2x power 1x int, 2x int 1x power for first line. For command I taking 2x stuck of glads (stuck=600units), 2x stuck of cataracts,
  and rest space of pikes. But you can take just one stuck from each and more pikes. For power and int is propably bes stuck glads, stuck cataracts and rest of pikes. This depend what nation attacking you or what players
  attacking you. But its almoust +- usable in any situation. ANY bad hero with bad units, ANY single stupid player can ruin rly easy whole defence. Low players cant be on def.
  <div class="mez"> </div>
 <b>Before:</b>
 Before you start fight inside shrine, you must get your hero inside, when you are not Misroku, some one propably intercept you and kill all your units, before you enter shrine = go watch TV, dont play tera. Then you need
 some things. Some one from another Rome guild can intercept you with low hero close to enemy shrine and you have 5min protection. Or you can use diplomatic imunity (click on hero, scrolls). Or rly good for every case
 have on your hero Retreat order better have more of them (some one intercept you, inside fight you click on this scroll he is near potions, USE IT FROM START). Or you have Marching Bulge, its perfect thing, you can instant port everywhere
 on your food sight, you can port right inside shrine, no one can do anything with that (Accurate Arrival, when you dont change timer, you are there instantly). Or you can come rly close to shrine with empty hero and
 use Troop Migration (click on hero, Assign units) and load your hero, you must do it outside of shrine, but you can stay rly close, laod units and fast go inside.<br>
   <div class="mez"> </div>
 <b>Inside:</b>
 When you are inside and your not PRO player, you rly dont know what to do. Just TAKE ALL YOUR FUCKING UNITS AND YOUR FUCKING HERO AND SEND IT ALL TO MAIN BUILDING. Then every 5sec click again to main building and again
 and again and again, that long as you have some units (this clicking is about, units can stuck or enemy heros using massive skills and units changing targets).<br>
   <div class="mez"> </div>
 When you are a little experienced player and you have good hero. You can try with your hero kill some enemy units or heros. Or take some pikes and try kills some units, but most of your units must STILL HITTING
 MAIN BUILDING. <b>NEVER</b> try kill enemy hero with your units, specialy not with t4 units like pikes. When you have t5 with you, try kill enemy army, during YOUR FUCKING PIKES STILL HITTING MAIN BUILDING. Pikes are best to hit
 main building, they have good defence and they make rly good dmg. Anyway you need to know what units to use against another, no sence try kill with cataracts egypt t5 pikes and etc, but this you must know from arena.
 When you dont know ask me or some one, he tell you what units are good against another units and what you need to be afraid when you have cataracts and other things.<br>
 You need all time controll all your units. When enemy hero use something like Warcry your units and heros change target to him, PAY ATTENTION. You need all time read chat, maybe some one try to tell you something. NEVER play on auto.
 Except when you have lags or you must rly rly go AFK, better send troops somewhere, click on auto and close the game. When you pres stand by and go off, your units will stay there and watch as your friends diing. I see this
 on my own eyes, we lost shrine about this. Dont put low heros arround shrines enemy can only make morale on you. And morale is rly important specialy on power hero.<br>

 Thats all for now, this is just just basic stuffs and tips. There is many many more things to know and learn.
